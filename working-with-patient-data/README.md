# Working with patient data

The patients who went to Gastroenterology Atlanta were briefed on confidentiality of their data. They filled in forms with questions about their clinical risk factors. They were de-identified and their clinical data was sent to the Jordan Lab, while their buccal samples were sent to Tempus Labs.

The Jordan Lab received the micro-array genotyped data for 15 samples from Tempus Labs (VCF files). The team also received the clinical data for 24 samples from Gastroenterology Atlanta.
